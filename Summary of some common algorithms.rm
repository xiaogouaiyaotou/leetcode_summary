HeapSort
The core idea of heapsort is let the biggest/smallest value into the top. We call these max heap/min heap.
There are three main steps to finish this algorithm. We use max heap as a example.
1.Build a max heap.
Find the last non-leaf node, and find and move the biggest one to this node from this node, its left child ,and its right child.
